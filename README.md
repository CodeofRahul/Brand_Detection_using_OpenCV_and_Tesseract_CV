# Brand_Detection_using_OpenCV_and_Tesseract_CV
This project demonstrates how to detect brand names from images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It leverages the power of Pytesseract and OpenCV to identify and extract text from images, then matches the extracted text with a predefined list of brand names.
